Create a directory to store your library files.

File|Project Structure|SDK's|<Your SDK>|ClassPath - Add the directory you just created.

Now if you have libraries with Lua definitions already, you can just point to their directory, or place them in the directory you created.

If your API has no Lua definitions, you will need to make a Lua file and define functions for each Name you want to resolve:

function foo1 end
function foo2 end
function foo3 end

This gets you auto-completion for these names.

You can also get quick navigate docs by supplying a properties file in the same directory with name = documentation entries

foo1 = foo1's doc
foo2 = foo2's doc
foo3 = foo3's doc
